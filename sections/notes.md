- Want to build on what Marcel wrote in his thesis *Strau√ü, M. (2021). Generation and detection of neutral polypeptide beams. Master.*
	
    Focus was mass spectrometry and the use of SSPDs as particle detectors
    My focus will be advances in this.

    - Ion beam profileometry
    - Slow Ion detection
    - Neutral peptide detection


# Introduction
Literature review and presentation of results therein.
Nice opening words for project, the field and those collaborating in it. Give a broad scope of the interesting aspects.
## Progress in mass spectrometry
Review the progress in the most recent years in MS, give the reader (and myself) a feel for the direction in which it is heading. Interesting discoveries, technological advances, and open issues shall be discussed here.

## Progress in SNWD technologies
Review the progress of SNWDs in the most recent years. What boundaries have been pushed, what limitations have been faced?
