\chapter{Introduction}
It was clear early on in the development of methods to analyze substances, that doing so via its mass constituents would be incredibly useful. As the field of mass spectrometry (MS) evolved, methods such as time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) became ubiquitous tools. These have gone through many generations of development and the trials and tribulations that go along with it. Specifically interesting for SuperMaMa is electrospray ionization (ESI) TOF-MS, or ESI-TOF-MS, for its wide range of substances that can be analyzed with this method. If the analyte can be dissolved well in solution, then it's already likely to be
